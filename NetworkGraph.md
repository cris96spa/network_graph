# Transactional Data Analysis and Machine Learning Approaches

## 1. Model Transactions as a Graph

- **Nodes and Edges**: Represent entities (e.g., customers, accounts) as nodes and transactions as edges.
- **Directed Graph**: Model the graph as directed to preserve transaction direction.
- **Edge Attributes**: Incorporate transaction details as edge attributes (e.g., amount, timestamp, transaction type).

## 2. Graph Sampling Techniques

- **Random Sampling**: Randomly select a subset of nodes or edges.
- **Snowball Sampling**: Start from a seed node and explore connected nodes up to a certain depth.
- **Topological Sampling**: Focus on nodes with specific characteristics (e.g., high degree nodes).

## 3. Community Detection and Clustering

- **Algorithms**: Use Louvain or Girvan-Newman to detect communities.
- **Insights**: Identify clusters of accounts that frequently transact among themselves.

## 4. Graph Visualization Tools

- **Gephi**: For handling large graphs.
- **Cytoscape**: For complex networks.
- **D3.js**: Web-based dynamic and interactive graph visualizations.

## 5. Compute Graph Metrics

- **Centrality Measures**: Degree, betweenness, closeness centrality.
- **PageRank**: Adapt to identify central nodes.
- **Clustering Coefficient**: Understand the tendency of nodes to cluster.

## 6. Anomaly and Fraud Detection

- **Feature Engineering**: Create features based on graph metrics.
- **Unsupervised Methods**: Use Isolation Forest, Autoencoders for anomalies.
- **Temporal Patterns**: Analyze transaction patterns over time.

## 7. Temporal Network Analysis

- **Dynamic Graphs**: Model as a series of graphs over time.
- **Event Detection**: Identify significant network structure changes.
- **Visualization**: Use animations or interactive timelines.

## 8. Dimensionality Reduction and Embeddings

- **Node2Vec or DeepWalk**: Generate node embeddings.
- **Visualization**: Use t-SNE or UMAP to visualize in 2D.
- **Application**: Embeddings for downstream tasks like classification or regression.

## 9. Leverage Big Data Technologies

- **Distributed Computing**: Use Spark or Hadoop.
- **GraphFrames**: In Spark, use GraphFrames or GraphX.
- **Scalability**: Ensure tools can scale with the dataset size.

## 10. Predictive Modeling

- **Supervised Learning**: Predict outcomes with labeled data.
- **Semi-Supervised Learning**: Use graph structures to propagate labels.
- **Feature Selection**: Insights from EDA to select relevant features.

## 11. Collaborative Filtering Techniques

- **Recommendation Systems**: Predict future transactions.
- **Matrix Factorization**: Decompose transaction matrices for latent features.

## 12. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)

- **Simplified Models**: Start with GCNs for node classification.
- **Frameworks**: Use PyTorch Geometric or DGL.
- **Transfer Learning**: Fine-tune pre-trained models.

## 13. Anomaly Detection with Autoencoders

- **Graph Autoencoders**: Encode and reconstruct graph structure for anomalies.
- **Application**: Detect nodes or transactions that deviate from patterns.

## 14. Privacy and Compliance Considerations

- **Anonymization**: Ensure all personal data is anonymized.
- **Synthetic Data**: Use for testing models without risking sensitive information.

## 15. Domain Knowledge Integration

- **Expert Input**: Collaborate with domain experts to validate findings.
- **Custom Metrics**: Develop metrics specific to banking transactions.

## 16. Use of Advanced Visualization Techniques

- **Heatmaps and Chord Diagrams**: For aggregated views of transaction volumes.
- **Sankey Diagrams**: Visualize flow of transactions between groups.
- **Interactive Dashboards**: Build dynamic querying and filtering dashboards.

## 17. Focus on Subgraphs of Interest

- **Ego Networks**: Analyze the network from a particular nodeâ€™s perspective.
- **Motif Analysis**: Identify small subgraph patterns.

## 18. Statistical Analysis

- **Degree Distribution**: Understand connections per node distribution.
- **Power Law Analysis**: Check if the network follows a scale-free property.

## 19. Scalable Machine Learning Pipelines

- **Incremental Learning**: Models that learn as new data arrives.
- **Batch Processing**: Process data in batches to manage memory.

## 20. Cross-Validation Strategies

- **Time-based Splitting**: Use temporal order for training and testing splits.

## Next Steps

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and preprocess the data.
2. **Pilot Studies**: Prototype approaches on a data subset.
3. **Iterative Exploration**: Refine hypotheses and methods.
